**React Birthday Card Builder, with no registration needed.**

I choose to believe that everything adds up, that I make a difference—even the projects that don't seem to have an apparent impact. To me, they're paths already walked or yet to be walked.

Today, at 41 years old, I launched tarjetagratis.com: a project built with React and Context API, conceived as an excuse to keep learning while offering an alternative to what's already out there.

Time simply flies. Thank you to my family and all the good vibes people.

I needed a card for my son's birthday, so I made a builder. You don't need to register; you just edit and generate a card with a short code, share it, and that's all. It takes 2 or 3 clicks. Or, you can deeply customize cards.

Technologies Used
React, TypeScript, and Laravel
PrimeReact: component library.
Animate.css: text animations. Animate.css
Card 3D effect: inspired by the WebDev Diaries video - Bird Hover Effect. Video
Fonts: all from Google Fonts Google Fonts
Images and backgrounds: generated with Google AI Studio Google AI Studio

```
npm run install
npm run dev
```

You need to set up the backend for all of this to generate the card. However, you can see a full preview of the card in the React part until you click the "Generate Card" button.

<!-- PORTFOLIO_DATA_START
**Stack:** React, TypeScript, PrimeFlex, PrimeReact, Laravel APIs.
**Description:** Tarjetagratis – a birthday card creation tool.
**What I've learned and tested:**
- Client-side React is not SEO-friendly by default, and I struggled to fully understand how SEO works in this setup.
- I implemented i18n for translations, but it became messy and hard to maintain.
- At the time, I used AI with less experience than I have today; it’s easy to get lost in the hype and implement things without fully understanding them.
- This project helped me shift my mindset: today I use AI primarily as a learning and reasoning tool, not just for code generation.
