**React Birthday Card Builder, with no registration needed.**

I choose to believe that everything adds up, that I make a differenceâ€”even the projects that don't seem to have an apparent impact. To me, they're paths already walked or yet to be walked.

Today, at 41 years old, I launched tarjetagratis.com: a project built with React and Context API, conceived as an excuse to keep learning while offering an alternative to what's already out there.

Time simply flies. Thank you to my family and all the good vibes people.

I needed a card for my son's birthday, so I made a builder. You don't need to register; you just edit and generate a card with a short code, share it, and that's all. It takes 2 or 3 clicks. Or, you can deeply customize cards.
